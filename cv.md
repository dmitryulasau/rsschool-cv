My second passion is travelling. And I have a dream - to build a teleport. You can travel around the world at any time, instead of buying tickets for plane you will buy a spot at any place (where it allowed). And in a seconds you are on the beach. "Travel is the Only Thing You Buy that Makes You Richer".
