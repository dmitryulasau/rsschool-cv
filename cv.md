### **About Myself:**

I'm a curious and driven person. My background in professional gaming and passion for computers have informed my approach to coding as each of these require , concentration, attention to details and improvement.

My ability to learn new skills quickly makes me an asset to any team.

My second passion is travelling. And I have a dream - to build a teleport. You can travel around the world at any time, instead of buying tickets for plane you will buy a spot at any place (where it allowed). And in a seconds you are on the beach. "Travel is the Only Thing You Buy that Makes You Richer".
